# Early Financial Distress Detection System
Hackathon AMAD – Team Narj

Project Duration: June 2025

A machine learning–based system developed during **AMAD Hackathon** to predict early financial distress among bank customers. The system analyzes financial indicators and provides clear predictions with explanatory reasons through an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Banks often struggle with early detection of customers at risk of financial distress due to multiple overlapping financial factors.  
This project aims to support early intervention by predicting whether a customer is financially stable or at risk, using supervised machine learning techniques.
